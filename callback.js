//In my callback homework assignment, I decided to do a alarm clock-like callback function.
//I passed my object which is morningReminder and/or 120000 which is 2 minutes converted into 120000 millseconds to my function which is as a paramenter

const morningReminder = function() {
    console.log("You have to get up so you won't be late to school for 8:00 pm");
}
morningRemindert();
setTimeout(morningReminder, 120000);
